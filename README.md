# PICTURE_CAPTION_GENERATOR
This is the project on Captioning the Picture using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that is used for extracting features from the image. Then, the Long Short Term Memory is fed with the extracted features to generate the caption about the picture. Thus, this model gives the caption to the picture with the help of trained CNN and LSTM model.
